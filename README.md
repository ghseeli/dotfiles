# ghseeli-env
This repository is my personal linux environment setup.

Thus far, it only includes
* My universal .bashrc settings.
* My universal .vim settings.
* My universal .emacs settings.

I am working on the following
* My gitconfig settings
* My zsh settings for oh-my-zsh on Mac

To use appropriately, this repository should be cloned
and then the appropriate symlinks have to be made by
using the init script.

The end goal of this project is to make it so that
whenever I am on a new box, I can just clone this
repository and be ready to go with personal settings.

NOTE: This repository should not contain any software
that should be installed at a system level.
